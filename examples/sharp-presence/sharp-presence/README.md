# Sharp-Presence Demo
This demo solution opens a simple GUI and updates the discord rich presence when the button is clicked

It includes a modified wrapper which is based on the Unity button clicker demo and extended to support UTF-8 under Visual C#

To be able to run it you need to copy the discord-rpc.dll into the project.
